// EXERCISE: The Fortune Teller

// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

// Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
// Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var numberOfChildren = 2;
var partnersName = "Eric";
var geographicLocation = "Cincinnati";
var jobTitle = "Senior Basketweaver";

console.log("You will be a " + jobTitle + " in " + geographicLocation + ", and married to " + partnersName + " with " + numberOfChildren + " kids.")

// EXERCISE: The Age Calculator

// Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it!

// Store the current year in a variable.
// Store their birth year in a variable.
// Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.
// Output them to the screen like so: "They are either NN or NN", substituting the values.

var currentYear = 2013;
var birthYear = 1979;
var age1 = currentYear-birthYear;
var age2 = currentYear-1-birthYear;

console.log("They are either "+ age1 + " or " + age2);

// EXERCISE: The Lifetime Supply Calculator

// Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

// Store your current age into a variable.
// Store a maximum age into a variable.
// Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
// Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
// Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".

var age=24
var maxAge=100
var snackPerDay = 2
var lifetimeSupply=(100-24)*365*2

console.log("You will need " + lifetimeSupply + " to last you until the ripe old age of " + maxAge)

// EXERCISE: The Geometrizer

// Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

// Store a radius into a variable.
// Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
// Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

var radius = 5
var circumference = 

// EXERCISE: The Temperature Converter

// It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

// Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
// Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
